# Hyper-realistic farming simulator

## The most realistic, but least fun farming game

New description:

```text
The most realistic, but least fun farming game (everything is set to real life, so you can wait a year in real time for wheat to grow and harvest, instead of 2 minutes more or less)
```

An example of why farming video games don't make you wait this long

* Pesticides, weeds, and disease (a dose of reality)

* Wheat (about 180 days, instead of 2 minutes (Hay Day) or ? (other farming games))

* Corn (about 180 days, instead of 5 minutes (Hay Day) or ? (other farming games))

* Other crops

* Weather

* Watering

* Managing your rent (optional gameplay option)

I'm done here. If anyone is interested in developing this concept, make a pull request.
